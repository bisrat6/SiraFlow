Siraflow is a robust backend solution for streamlined payroll processing and employee time tracking. Designed for modern businesses, it automates salary calculations, bonus allocations, and direct disbursements via integrated mobile payment systems like Arifpay Telebirr B2C. Whether managing a small team or a larger enterprise, Siraflow ensures accuracy, security, and efficiency in handling workforce payments—reducing manual errors and saving valuable time.

At its heart, Siraflow empowers employers with real-time oversight of employee hours, automated payroll cycles (daily, weekly, or monthly), and seamless transfers to mobile wallets. Employees benefit from simple clock-in/out tools and transparent earnings tracking. By integrating authentication, data validation, and scheduled tasks, Siraflow transforms payroll from a chore into a seamless workflow.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure JWT-based signup, login, and role-based access for employers and employees, including password changes for added security.
- **Company Management**: Customize settings like payment cycles, bonus multipliers, and track company-wide stats with detailed views and updates.
- **Employee Management**: Add, update, or remove employees with details including hourly rates and Telebirr mobile numbers for payouts; includes personal profile access.
- **Time Tracking**: Effortless clock-in/out with break management, automatic calculation of regular hours, overtime, and bonuses; includes status approvals, notes, and company/employee-specific queries.
- **Automated Payroll**: Computes salaries based on logged hours and cycles; supports bulk processing, approvals, retries for failed payments, and webhook integrations for reliability.
- **Payment Integration**: Direct B2C transfers via Arifpay Telebirr API, with webhook handling for real-time status updates (e.g., SUCCESS, PENDING, FAILED), summaries, and detailed histories.
- **Job Roles Management**: Create, update, or delete job roles to organize your workforce structure.
- **Analytics**: Generate attendance reports and retrieve comprehensive analytics for informed decision-making.
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Cron-like automation for payroll runs at midnight daily, Sundays weekly, or the 1st of each month; includes cleanup for old failed payments.
- **Security Measures**: Rate limiting, input sanitization, CORS, Helmet for headers, and bcrypt for password hashing.

Siraflow prioritizes user experience by separating roles—employers get full dashboard access, while employees see only their personal logs and profiles. It's ideal for businesses in regions relying on mobile money, offering a reliable, culturally attuned payroll solution.

## Tech Stack

Siraflow is built with a modern JavaScript backend stack for scalability and ease of maintenance:

- **Runtime**: Node.js (v14 or higher)
- **Framework**: Express.js for handling API routes and middleware
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose for schema-based modeling
- **Authentication**: JWT for token-based auth, bcrypt for secure password hashing
- **Security**: Helmet for HTTP headers, express-rate-limit for API protection, CORS for cross-origin requests
- **Payments**: Arifpay Telebirr B2C API integration via HTTP requests
- **Scheduling**: Node-cron or similar for automated payroll and cleanup tasks
- **Other Libraries**: Joi or equivalent for input validation, Nodemon for development

The architecture follows a RESTful API design, with modular routes for authentication, company/employee management, time logs, payments, job roles, and analytics. Database models (e.g., User, Company, Employee, TimeLog, Payment) ensure structured data handling, while middleware enforces role-based access and error handling.

### Database Models

Siraflow uses Mongoose schemas for data integrity:

- **User**: `{ email, password (hashed), role ('employer'/'employee'), companyId, isActive }`
- **Company**: `{ name, paymentCycle ('daily'/'weekly'/'monthly'), bonusMultiplier, maxDailyHours }`
- **Employee**: `{ name, hourlyRate, telebirrMsisdn, position, department }`
- **TimeLog**: `{ employeeId, clockIn, clockOut, duration, regularHours, bonusHours, status ('pending'/'approved'), notes }`
- **Payment**: `{ employeeId, amount, period, status ('PENDING'/'SUCCESS'/'FAILED'), arifpayTransactionId, paymentDate, timeLogIds }`

These models support relationships (e.g., via ObjectId references) for efficient querying during payroll.
